# kelvinweather
 Converts Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

INFORMATION
<li>The assumption in the program is that the day's forecast is 293 Kelvin.</li>
<li>Celsius is similar to Kelvin. However, the difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees less than Kelvin.</li>
<li>The equation for Fahrenheit used — <code>Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32</code>.</li>
<li>Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion often gives a decimal number. Hence, the Fahrenheit temperature was rounded down.</li>
<li>The program also works for any Kelvin temperature — just change the value of kelvin and run the program again.</li>
<li>The equation for Celsius to Newton used — <code>Newton = Celsius * (33/100)</code>.</li>
<li>The Newton temperature was also rounded down like the Fahrenheit temperature.</li>
